4. Automation (CI/CD)
Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).
The pipeline must, at minimum: - Build and - Test the application image successfully.


5. Security Fundamentals
Implement solutions to secure the application environment, including (but not limited to): - Managing secrets (e.g., in Docker Compose) - Ensuring secure container configuration (non-root users, least privileges)


--> improve local orchestration by setting secrets differently in docker-compose

--> github Actions
- checkout; SAST; build; SCA (docker scout); Test; Deploy su AWS

- checkout && SAST && docker build && SCA
- docker test
- docker deploy

--> deploy k8s cluster in AWS

--> deploy k8s manifests

--> implement Monitoring Solution for tracking key application metrics such as: - Request latency - Error rates - Container health
